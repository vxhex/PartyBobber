PartyBobber
===========

Repo for DEF CON PartyBobber information.

The bobber itself was first acquired at BSidesLV2011 and served valiantly as a beer cooler for DefCon 19. It also collected quite a few stickers along the way. While already fairly awesome, we decided upgrades were in order.

On-Board Systems
-------

The PartyBobber has multiple electronics systems. Most of the wiring is mounted externally for to allow for maximum internal beverage storage.

<b>Sound System (v1.0)</b>

2 iHome portable USB speakers daisy chained to a 2gig iPod Shuffle. The speakers and iPod contain their own batteries with 6-10 hours of life, and run independantly of other systems.

<b>Scrolling LCD Banner (v2.0)</b>

The scrolling banner used an Arduino UNO with an attached Adafruit B&W LCD Shield with keypad and 16x2 character display (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-RGB-LCD-Shield-Library). Both the LCD banner and PirateBox systems run off of a RAVPower 10400mAh RP-PB07 battery pack.
